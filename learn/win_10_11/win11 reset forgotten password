[Steps]
1.  Hold LeftShift and select Restart from Log On menu, keep holding left shift
# this will take you to windows trouble shooting once the pc restarts fully

2.  Go to Troubleshoot > Advanced Options > CMD (command prompt)
# this will open up a command prompt window

3.  Type: echo %windir%
# This will show what drive Windows 11 is stored on (typically C:, but can be on any drive)

4.  Type: cd C
# Path to root of C drive directory, if Windows 11 is stored on D, then type appropriate letter

5.  Type: cd Windows\System32
# this will take you to System32

6.  Type: ren Utilman.exe utilman1.exe
# this will rename Utility Manager

7.  Type: ren cmd.exe utilman.exe
# this will rename CMD(command line) to Utility Manager

8.  Now exit the CMD, and press Continue to Windows 11
# this will exit the session and take you to log in

9.  Once at Log In, click at the Utility Manager icon in bottom right corner
# this will now open up CMD(command line) which we have renamed Utility Manager

10. In CMD, go to the relevant Windows installed drive, type: control userpasswords2, press Enter.
# this will open up the Windows User Accounts window which contains permissions for all users.

11. Select the user which you're stuck on, press Reset Password, and then press OK. Then close the User Account window and the CMD window
# this will effectively reset the password of that specific user account

12. At Log In, go to the specific user's account and type in your new password and press Enter
# this will create a new password for that account. Remember to save the new password so it is not forgotten.

13. Open CMD and revert step 7, then step 6.
# this will restore the program names to their default. Remember to do it in right order.
